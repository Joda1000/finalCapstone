# Task manager

This program displays my knowledge of modular, custom-function based code in Python, with user experience at the centre of design. It offers user and task management functionalities, linked with an intuitive menu structure. 

## Description

The program offers a menu of functionalities to a logged-in user. These include registering a new user, and a set of options around task management: the user can add a new task, view all tasks, as well as view only the tasks assigned to the logged in user. The user can mark the tasks assigned to them as complete, reassign them to a different user or change the due date. The admin can additionally generate reports with user and tasks statistics into text files, and read the statistics from the report files and view them in the terminal.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

The program uses:
*  os library
*  datetime and date modules from the datetime library

### Installing

* Download the files and open using any IDE suitable for Python.
* Ensure you open the whole folder for this task in VS Code otherwise the program will look in your root directory for the text files.

### Usage

Use the following username and password to login when first running the program and to access the admin rights 
username: admin
password: password
